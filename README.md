**Virtual Desktop Number** (`vdn`) is a tool for Windows 10 and 11 that sits in the system tray/notification area and displays the number of the current virtual desktop.

It supports both light and dark themes, and is designed so as not to look out of place next to the system icons.

## Requirements
- [.NET 6.0 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime)

## Installation

Virtual Desktop Number is portable, so no installation is required:
- Download and unzip the [latest release](https://github.com/esvres/vdn/releases/latest)
- Run `VirtualDesktopNumber.exe`
